"""
Blockchain.py is meant to parse, read, and write data to the blockchain directory. There will be less
internal logic here than in Node.py. It will use only Node.py as an entry point, there will be no data
validation here. Information about the blockchain can be easily returned via functions in this file:
Blocks in total, transactions in block, transactions in total, etc.
